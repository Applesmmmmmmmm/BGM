BGM is a from scratch rewrite of a music player addon for ffxi using Ashita interface v4.3


SetBGM was the original inspiration, though it's diverged significantly at this point. 
<br>The windower version of SetBGM can be found: https://docs.windower.net/addons/setbgm/
<br>My port to Ashita, is unmaintained, but can be found here: https://github.com/Applesmmmmmmmm/SetBGM/
